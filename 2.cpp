// // 1. encapsulation = data(properties)+member functions
// Encapsulation involves bundling the data(attributes) and methods(functions)
//  that operate on the data into a single unit(class) and restricting access to some of the object's components.
//  This is often done by using access specifiers:

// Private: Members declared as private are accessible only within the same class.
// Public: Members declared as public can be accessed from outside the class.
// private = data hiding encapsulation

// 2. abstraction

// 3. inheritance

// 4.polymorphism

//  constructor is a special member function of a class that is automatically called when an object of the class is created. The primary purpose of a constructor is to initialize the object's members to appropriate initial values. Constructors are special because they do not have a return type, not even void, and their name is the same as the class name.
